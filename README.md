# Alarm-Clock
This program reads a time that you insert and plays a sound when the time comes. 

To run properly you will need to install the playsound module with this command:
  'pip install playsound'. 
I do not recomment to install the latest version, instead install the version 1.2.2 with the command:
  'pip install playsound==1.2.2'
If you already have installed the latest version of the playsound module try uninstalling it first with this command:
  'pip uninstall playsound' and then press 'y' to proceed, after that try installing the version I recommend.
*All commands are for Windows*
